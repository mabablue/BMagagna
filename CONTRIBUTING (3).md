# **GFF Curation workflow for FAIR Supporting Resources (FSR) metadata**

## **Introduction**

Please be aware that only qualified FIP (or 3PFF) implementers, facilitators or trainers can participate in this process. Please check this [table ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hLEimbWKdlyouIF4ZoerGG6mia58c98PsVQ8hIT4hqw/edit#gid=0)if your name is already registered. 

An FSR curation process requires **two qualified people** to curate new FSR nanopubs. The first person acts as editor and checks if there exist more than one nanopub for the same FSR and checks the quality of the best nanopub (usually the newest) while proposing to retract the duplicates. The editor will then propose if the FSR nanopub should be accepted as is, requires changes or should be retracted. The editor assigns a reviewer, preferably one with expertise related to the FSR type, to check the action proposal for the FSR. The reviewer can accept it, request changes or reject it. If the reviewer’s answer is positive, the editor can follow the actions proposed to finally approve it. 

The whole curation process is supposed to be described in GitHub issues in this GitHub repository. To collaborate you need a GitHub account and the administrator needs to add the new reviewer to the curation team to grant write access to this repository.


## **Overall curation procedure**


**![img](images/fig1.png)**

### **1 Editor actions**

#### 1A. Choose an issue 
from GitHub: https://github.com/gofair-foundation/fsr_curation/issues - these issues are created by a [GitHub action](#appendix-b-refreshing-the-github-issues-list) which looks not curated FSRs in Nanodash.  
   These can be filtered by label (FSR type) from https://github.com/gofair-foundation/fsr_curation/labels  
   Assign it to you (so that everybody can see that you are working on it)

#### 1B. Check for duplicates

1. Use the API: [check duplicates](https://peta-pico.github.io/tapas/tapas.html?api=peta-pico/dsw-nanopub-api&op=/find_gofair_qualified_things_x) by searching with the most common name (and similar names) of the FSR if there exists more than one nanopub.
2. The goal is to keep only the most informative nanopub, bear in mind that you should also check for the most frequently used resource in the FIPs/SIPs. Check their utilisation using the FSR thing URI within the [FSR in FIP/SIP API](https://github.com/peta-pico/dsw-nanopub-api/blob/main/tables/new_matrix_reduced.csv). However the most frequently used nanopub may need to be improved (as per the process in [F3B](#f-3b-proposal-accept-with-improvements) below).
3. Duplicates will need to retracted/disapproved (see [F3C](#f-3c-when-the-fsr-nanopub-should-be-retracted)) and any accompanying GitHub issues closed accordingly. Therefore it is essential that the same person(s) work on all duplicates of one resource.
4. Start with the GitHub issue of the nanopub that you want to keep.  


#### 1C. Quality check 
the existing nanopublication that provides the metadata of a FSR and document it:
   Edit the issue description. Ensure that you do not edit/remove the nanopub URI in the first line of the issue. 
   
![gh_issue_md_edit](images/gh_issue_md_edit.png)

   Complete the **"Document quality check"** table by editing it between the pipe (|) delimiters, the click on 'Update comment' when you are done.
  
![gh_issue_md_editing](images/gh_issue_md_editing.png)

   You can use the preview function to check that your additions are in the table correctly:
   
   ![gh_issue_md_edit_preview](images/gh_issue_md_edit_preview.png)

1. Add your name and ORCID

2. Add the FSR long name and the FSR thing URI (= subject URI, the identifier of the resource itself)

3. Add all URIs of duplicate(s) if they exist using the *Check Duplicates API*
  
4. Check if the web links provided are working (add Y or N)
   
5. Propose new web links if needed
   
7. Check if the description is informative enough or if it needs to be corrected/improved (add Y or N)

8. Check if the allocated FSR types are all correct (add Y or N)
  
9. Check if the resource is described in FAIRsharing and if there exists a DOI. If so, then check if the Nanopub already refers to it. In case the FAIRsharing does not refer to it, add it in the table. Be aware that FAIRsharing has not all types included and thus not all resources will have a reference in FAIRsharing.
  
11. If the FSR was created in the FIP/SIP wizard add F or S in the table, otherwise if it was created in nanodash, add the ORCID of the creator. In addition, check if the `prov:wasDerivedFrom` in the pubinfo section of the nanopublication resolves to the correct FSR project in the wizard (see https://github.com/fip-wizard/fip-wizard/issues/1)

Finally,

#### 1D. Propose an action:

1. accept as is (A)
2. improve (I)
3. reject (Retract - R in case it was created in the FIP Wizard, or Disapprove - D, if it was created in Nanodash)
4. add proposed changes if you want it to be improved.
   
and assign a reviewer to check the proposal based on his/her expertise. If the reviewer doesn’t respond within 24 hours, check for another reviewer.

### 2 Reviewer actions 

You will have received an email alert for the assigned issue and can review the proposed changes in the issue.

Then you decide either to:

2A. approve the proposal (A)  
2B. accept the proposal with some required improvements (I)  
2C. reject the proposal (R)

To document your decision you are asked to:
**Issues 639 onwards** (new template):  
   a. Add your name and ORCID to the **"Review"** table of the GitHub issue  
   b. Capture your decision on whether you **Approve**, or **Reject** or **Improve** (with comments)  
**Issues up to 638**:  
   a. Capture your decision on whether you **Approve**, or **Request changes** (or **Comment** if you need further information or have a different opinion on the course of action) as a comment on the issue: 
   
   ![gh_issue_comment](images/gh_issue_comment.png)

Reassign the issue back to the editor.


### 3 Final Editor actions

As the editor perform the actions based on the reviewer decision. 
- if the proposal is accepted with changes: negotiate with the reviewer and makes adjustments until both of you are satisfied;
- if the reviewer accepts the proposal: proceed with the proposed action:

3A. proposal - accept as is: approve the FSR nanopub with the [approval nanopub template](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/publish?55&template=https://w3id.org/np/RApEyTXPOt_h81Ao0WpzRhigcgvqrbnNBCo8fEpsZ6CxU)  
3B. proposal - accept with improvements: proceed with the improvement (see below)  
3C. proposal - reject: the editor disapprove/retract the nanopub (see below).  


3D. If the reviewer rejects your proposal, assign the issue to a second reviewer. You should follow the decision that has at least two supportersd.

#### 3B Proposal accept with improvements:

Make sure to get in contact with the creator of the FSR nanopub before you change the metadata. If you can’t get any response write an email to the creator with your intended change or, in case you don’t have the email, inform about the change in a comment directly in the FIP Wizard FSR project. 

1. If the creator is the FIP Wizard 
   1. find the project, improve the metadata and publish a new nanopub
   2. approve the FSR nanopub with the [approval nanopub template](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/publish?55&template=https://w3id.org/np/RApEyTXPOt_h81Ao0WpzRhigcgvqrbnNBCo8fEpsZ6CxU)

2. If the creator is documented via an ORCID (then you have to work with nanodash)
   1. search for the nanopub-URI in the search of Nanodash
   2. update as derived nanopublication, copy the URI of the subject in the original FSR nanopub into the short name, improve metadata and publish it
   3. in case you want to use a new template use this procedure: https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/publish?template=*newTemplateURI*&supersede=*oldNanopubURI* and copy the URI of the subject in the original FSR nanopub into the short name, improve metadata and publish it
   4. disapprove the old nanopub that has been superseeded with the nanopub with improved metadata
   5. approve the FSR nanopub with the [approval nanopub template](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/publish?55&template=https://w3id.org/np/RApEyTXPOt_h81Ao0WpzRhigcgvqrbnNBCo8fEpsZ6CxU)

If a FAIRsharing DOI needs to be added, in the FIP Wizard this can be added as a Resource URI to II.9 "Related resources to which this resource can be mapped to and which are used to derive its description". Similarly in nanodash this URI would be introduced as `exactMatch` in the last assertion statement and in the provenance of the nanopub use the statement "attributed to myself/others and (partly) derived from an existing entity" and add the DOI of the FAIRsharing record.

#### 3C When the FSR nanopub should be retracted

1. Check who is the creator: 
   1. If the creator is the FIP Wizard create a project with the Nanopublication Retraction template (under Custom templates) and follow the instructions to retract a FSR
   2. If the creator is documented with an ORCID (then you have to work with nanodash) use [this nanopub template](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/publish?14&template=http://purl.org/np/RAgXKeS8wLficVpkOIbU2aF5O5Zuy7KZ_3gNUr7D5BS8c) to disapprove the nanopub (keep in mind only ORCIDs of qualified facilitators will have an impact on the FIP Wizard filters). **Ensure that you use the** `http://purl.org/np/` (or `http://w3id.org/np/`) **URI and not the** `https://np.knowledgepixels.com/` **URI.** 

2. Check if the same thing is described by another nanopub:
   1. If the same thing has been updated by a newer FSR nanopub (Option A), all is done
   2. If the same thing is not updated by another FSR nanopub but the entry is rejected: 
      1. Check if the FSR is used in FIPs by using this API: [**find FSRs in FIP**](https://github.com/peta-pico/dsw-nanopub-api/blob/main/tables/new_matrix_reduced.csv)
      2. Delete choice in FIP
      3. Re-publish the FIP

# **Appendix A: Refreshing the GitHub issues list**

The GitHub issues list is populated from NanoDash by a custom GitHub [action](https://github.com/gofair-foundation/fsr_curation/actions/workflows/issue.yml). 
This will create issues for new not yet curated FSRs and close any open issues for FSRs that are no longer uncurated.

The action is currently scheduled to run at 04:30 UTC on Sundays; to trigger it manually (e.g. after a FIP workshop): 

1. Go to the ‘Actions’ tab (red box)
2. Click on ‘issue_creation’ (blue box) 
3. Click on ‘Run workflow’ (green box)
4. Click on the ‘Run workflow’ green button (orange box)
